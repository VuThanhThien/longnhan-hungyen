# Project Changelog

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-18

All notable changes to the Long Nhan Hung Yen e-commerce project are documented here. **Phase status** is canonical in [Project Roadmap](./project-roadmap.md).

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-18 - Production go-live (Phase 7)

### Summary

**Initial production deployment completed.** API, storefront, admin, and database are **live** on the planned platforms (see [Project Roadmap](./project-roadmap.md) — Phase 7 production targets and objectives). Post-launch: finish the 7-day monitoring objective and work through the pre-launch checklist where items are still open.

### Changed (process / product)

- Phase 7 marked **complete** (go-live milestone **100%**); roadmap task rollup **~92%** (~97/106 — monitoring + checklist still counted as open work)
- Production target table: services marked **Live**; Media CDN noted as in use

---

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-18 - Documentation & roadmap sync

### Summary

Refreshed `docs/` to match the repository: API **Categories** and **Reviews** modules, admin **categories** and **reviews** dashboard routes, storefront **checkout** / **track-order** / **service-unavailable** routes, and current component counts. No application behavior change in this entry.

### Changed (documentation only)

- [Codebase summary](./codebase-summary.md) — ApiModule inventory (12 feature modules), admin route tree, storefront routes and `components/**/*.tsx` count (~76)
- [Project overview & PDR](./project-overview-pdr.md) — Backend and admin capability lists aligned with code
- [Project roadmap](./project-roadmap.md) — Phase 4 expansion (cart/checkout deliverables), Phase 5 progress (categories + reviews), dates and task breakdown

---

## [4.2.1] - 2026-04-16 - Storefront homepage module refactor

### Summary

Small storefront housekeeping release: align homepage section components with the current home composition (`FeaturedProducts`, `VideoSection`) and remove legacy home product section modules.

### Removed

- `apps/web/src/components/home/home-products-by-category.tsx` — removed (replaced by homepage composition changes)
- `apps/web/src/components/home/home-products-section.tsx` — removed (use `featured-products.tsx`)

### Changed

- `apps/web` home page sections — use `FeaturedProducts` + `VideoSection` alongside `components/landing/*` sections

---

## [4.2.0] - 2026-04-13 - Storefront cart, search, and URL state

### Summary

Storefront updates: guest shopping cart, header search tied to query params, supporting libs and static assets. Phase 4 remains **complete** per [Project Roadmap](./project-roadmap.md); this release is incremental UX on top of that baseline.

### Added

- **`apps/web/src/app/cart/`** — Cart route (guest cart UI)
- **`apps/web/src/services/cart/`** — Zustand cart store with `localStorage` persistence (`cart-store.ts`, storage key `longnhan-cart-v2`)
- **`apps/web/src/components/layout/header-search-bar.tsx`** — Header search (works with URL state)
- **`apps/web/src/components/layout/header-cart-button.tsx`** — Header cart entry point
- **`apps/web/src/lib/product-search-params.ts`** — nuqs parsers / loader / serializer for product search params
- **`apps/web/src/lib/format-vnd.ts`**, **`format-phone-display.ts`** — Display helpers for storefront
- **`apps/web/public/`** — Additional marketing/UI assets (banners, backgrounds, icons)

### Changed

- **`header.tsx`**, **`mobile-nav.tsx`** — Integrate search and cart affordances
- **`app-providers.tsx`** — Provider wiring for storefront (e.g. nuqs adapter + existing app providers)
- **`products/page.tsx`**, **`lib/product-description.ts`** — Listing/content refinements aligned with search params
